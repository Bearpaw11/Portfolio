# Unit_02_Portfolio

This is my new portfolio page.

I used bootstrap to make the page responsive. I used Bootstrap Navbar,  Footer, cards, Jumbotron.

It was difficult to style the Navbar how I wanted as the Bootstrap code seemed to take president most of the time. I ended up putting it in a container to get Navbar content to align with the container in the body of the pages and had to use !important to get the background color to change. I also sturgled with the Hamburger button to get the Navbar to expand when it was pressed. I eneded up having to take off the custom css width of the header I put in so the header could then expand when hamburger was pressed.

I also had to change and use only one column on the index page body so the text would float around the picture,

I used Media Quires to make a few things smaller when the page gets smaller.

I had a hard time figuring out the column widths when the page get smaller. This is something that doesnâ€™t play a huge factor on these pages but I will need more practice on these to grasp the concept.
